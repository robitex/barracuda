# `barracuda` project

This is a pure Lua library for drawing barcode symbols. `barracuda` components'
are able to typeset barcode from within a LuaTeX document in order to produce a
PDF file, or is also possible to use a Lua standalone interpreter to draw
barcodes in different graphic format such as `SVG` (see an example below).

The internal modules are structured to ensure good performance beside of a
complete user control over barcode symbol parameters :thumbsup:

Although development is in beta stage, `barracuda` has a good level of
stability. The package does not have any dependences.

## Current version

Version: 0.0.10 - Date: 2020-02-04

## Barcode symbologies list

So far, the barcode symbologies supported by the package are:

- Code 39
- Code 128
- Interleaved 2 of 5 (ITF14, i2of5 general)
- EAN family (ISBN, ISSN, EAN8, EAN13, and the add-ons EAN5 and EAN2)
- UPC-A

Other 1D encoding symbology will be eventually added to the project, then it
will be the turn of 2D barcode types like Datamatrix, QRCode or PDF417.

## A very simple LaTeX example

The LaTeX package `barracuda.sty` under the cover uses Lua code so you need to
compile your source files with LuaTeX or LuajitTeX with the LaTeX format.

For instance, the follow is a minimal working example for LuaLaTeX:

```latex
% !TeX program = LuaLaTeX
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{barracuda}
\begin{document}
\barracuda{code39}{123ABC}
\end{document}
```

## Documentation

Details and package reference can be found in the manual delivered in the `doc`
project directory, even if actually it is very minimal at the moment.

Directory `test` contains files useful also for code examples.

## Installation

The `barracuda` package can be used with pure Lua interpreter or from within a
TeX source file for Lua-powered typesetting engine like LuaTeX. In the first
case you can manually copy `src` folder content to a suitable directory of
your system. Otherwise, you can install the package via `tlmgr` for your TeX
Live distribution.

If you have installed TeX Live with the `full` schema, `barracuda` is just
available and no further action is required. Please, take into account that
only the tagged version (in the `git` sense) of the package will be sent to
CTAN. This means that intermediate development version between consecutive
releases can be found only at <https://github.com/robitex/barracuda> .

TeX Live distribution or Lua interpreter executable are available for a very
large number of Operating Systems so it is also for `barracuda`.

Step by step instruction can be found in the INSTALL.txt file.

## Contribute

Contributes are welcome in any form and for any topics. You can contact me
directly via email at giaconet.mailbox@gmail.com or via a pull request direct to
the repository <https://github.com/robitex/barracuda> or writing a public
message via the web page <https://github.com/robitex/barracuda/issues> for
todos, bugs, feature requests, and more (press the bottom `New issue`).

Anyway, as a starting point take a look of PLANNER.txt file for the development
program.
