Installation
============

Installing `barracuda` for TeX Live
-----------------------------------

If you have TeX Live installed from CTAN or from DVD TeX Collection, before
any modification to your system check if the package is already installed
looking for `installed` key in the output of the command:

 $ tlmgr show barracuda

If `barracuda` is not present, run the command:

 $ tlmgr install barracuda

If you have installed TeX Live via Linux OS repository try your distribution's
package management system.

It's also possible a manual installation:

 a. Grab the sources from CTAN or https://github.com/robitex/barracuda .
 b. Unzip it at the root of one or your TDS trees.
 c. You may need to update some filename database after this running the command
    `texhash` on a terminal, see your TeX distribution's manual for details.

Any TeX Live documentation files can be easily opened on screen with the
`texdoc` command line utility (this way is very handy).

 $ texdoc pkgname

Installing for Lua
------------------

Manually copy the `src` folder content to a suitable directory of your system
that is reachable to a Lua interpreter.
